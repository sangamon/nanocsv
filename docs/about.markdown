A mini-series of posts evolving a minimalist CSV parser implementation in Scala. This will definitely _not_ result in a production-level library. The main goals are:

- Exploring failure modes/error handling.
- Exploring higher level abstractions.
- Exploring [Scala 3](https://docs.scala-lang.org/).
- Exploring [cats](https://typelevel.org/cats/) and [cats-effect](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/). (And maybe we'll get to [fs2](https://fs2.io/), as well.)
- Bringing all of this together in a small, but still somewhat real-world project.
- ...and for me: Exploring [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [github pages](https://pages.github.com/).
